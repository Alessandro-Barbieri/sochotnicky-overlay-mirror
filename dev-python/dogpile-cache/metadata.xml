A caching API built around the concept of a "dogpile lock", which
allows continued access to an expiring data value while a single thread
generates a new value.

dogpile.cache builds on the dogpile.core locking system, which implements the
idea of "allow one creator to write while others read" in the abstract.
Overall, dogpile.cache is intended as a replacement to the Beaker caching
system, the internals of which are written by the same author. All the ideas of
Beaker which "work" are re-implemented in dogpile.cache in a more efficient and
succinct manner, and all the cruft (Beaker's internals were first written in
2005) relegated to the trash heap.
